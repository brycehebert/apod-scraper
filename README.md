## APOD

A little project that pulls and displays images from NASA's [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/).

This Project Utilizes [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), and [React](https://reactjs.org/) as well as various helper modules.

The biggest challenge of this project is the fact that that APOD website uses no CSS whatsoever. Thus, there are no CSS selectors that can be used to pull the various datum needed. Luckily, the raw HTML that is used is very standard for every page so I was able to select the correct parts of each page.
